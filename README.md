# When-Food-Exists-but-Hunger-Persists
Identifying Food Supply–Access Disconnects in U.S. Counties

# Project Description
Despite the extensive food distribution infrastructure and high levels of food availability in the United
States, many regions experience high levels of structural barriers to food access. Instead of using food
insecurity as a measured outcome, this project takes a more specific approach by using the definitions
provided by the USDA for low-income and low-access conditions, as these are established proxy
measures for access-related hardship. The primary goal of this project is to determine counties in the
United States that experience high levels of low-income or low-access conditions, as defined by the
USDA, in spite of relatively high levels of food availability or infrastructure. Dollar Generals are reported
to open stores to offer low quality goods to the already marginalized populous. This additional research
goal will inform the complex relationship found between food access and income in our primary topic.
